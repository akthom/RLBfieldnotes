Which means that last summer they must have finished at 14’6” the floor.  We are unsure of whether or not they did drawing and pictures so we are going to do that today.  We are currently at about 14’8” to 14’9”.  There is also a frag from a Smilodon lower jaw that has fallen out of I-8 we will be dealing with that some time soon.  Today is also a plaster day we plan to start removing the plaster in H-8 that is covering the second half of the sloth pelvis.  We will take that plastered area down to floor, if it is not already there, add it to the drawings and continue from there of course this all has to happen the day before media day woohoo!
