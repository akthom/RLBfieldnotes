K. E. Vowels:  
Samantha’s not here today and no volunteers are scheduled this morning.  Tara is expected this afternoon.  The tank for the toilet arrived this morning.  Bruce is connecting it, or at least attempting to.  It appears that it was cut last year and well it’s not going to connect.  Bruce went and got some parts to make it all work.
	I glopped this morning.  Started setting up the gridlines, ran out of white twine.  Hmm… I will finish the grid lines when Tara is here since it is easier w/ 2 people.
	I’ll take out the trash in the meantime and make sure we have the supplies we’ll need this year.
